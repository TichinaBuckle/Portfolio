# ABOUT ME
Hi, I'm Tichina! A data scientist in the making, refining my skills through projects with a keen interest in predicting the future and telling stories in visually engaging ways. I have a background in Computer Science, Graphic Design, Research, and Strategic Planning, and I aim to combine these skills to help make the world a little better. 📉 One data-driven decision at a time! 📝

This repository showcases the projects I have completed or am currently working on, as well as those that are part of my learning journey. These are the projects I’m most proud of or find interesting enough to share.
