<br>
- **Challenge:** Create a comprehensive visual analytics solution to track personal spending patterns and identify opportunities for financial optimization.
- **Approach:** Designed a structured data collection system using Google Forms for consistent daily financial tracking.

Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard with multiple interconnected views for comprehensive financial analysis.
